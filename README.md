TGT experiment suite A: resolution & error

Establish empirical understanding of TGT temperature gradient
- Resolution: temp/distance (within gusset and between gussets)
- Time: temp/time (variability at equilibrium, rate of change)
- Predictability: In an experiment we will have X hobos and manually ground truth X times or locations - what accuracy in measurement will this give us over all predictions? 
Goal: be able to plan an experiment with either 1. A steady temp gradient or 2. A variable temp gradient, and predict the temperature at a given point in the soil as a function of the temperatures set at either end and the time:
Steady state: T_x,y,t=f( TA ,TB, t, x, y)where T_x,y,t is the temperature at a given space and time, TA ,TBare the temperatures set on the circulators, and t, x, and y are time, x coordinate, and y coordinate. 


Experiment 1: 
Does temperature vary along the length of a gusset?
Measure temperature along the length of each gusset, in 2 inch increments, at 25%, 50%, and 75% of the distance from the aluminum sheets. 
Analyze for variance due to position (ANOVA): does position within the gusset affect temperature? 
Calculate the correlation between the HOBO measurements and the temperature: to what degree can we use the HOBO to measure the entire gusset? 

Experiment 2:
